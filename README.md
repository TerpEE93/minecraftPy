# minecraftPy
A collection of programs leveraging RaspberryJuice to interact with Minecraft 

This is mostly for playing around with my kids -- teaching them a bit of Python, and maybe
learning a bit more myself, while playing a game that definitely holds their attention.
Don't expect greatness here.  Don't even expect mediocrity.  But maybe we'll do something
interesting here, so feel free to follow along.
